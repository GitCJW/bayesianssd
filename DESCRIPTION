Description: This software is develvoped to calculate the lowest possible sample size needed to achieve a desired power in an experiment. The sample size determination can be accessed through a graphical user interface The experiment data are simulated by a Bayesian model. For a better efficiency, the neccessary number of simulations is approximated by the results of a beta model. To decide whether a just checked sample size is too low or high enough, power is estimated by a binomial model. To get the next sample size that should be checked, a logistic-like linear approximation of the sample size needed to reach the desired power was implemented.
